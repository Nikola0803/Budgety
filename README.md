# Budgety
Home or Personal Budget Tracking App built with JS 


Really useful app that you can use to track your monthly budget.

Using it is really simple, just run index.html in any broswer and start tiping in your expences and incomes.

The app will automatically add or substract and output the leftover budget for that month. 


I have a plan on creating an online service with it so it should become available as an online app in the next couple of months
